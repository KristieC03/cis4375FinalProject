            <h1>About James Andersen</h1>

            <img src="/images/andersen.jpeg" alt="James Andersen" class="about-float-img" />

            <p>
              James Andersen has practiced law for over 44 years, bringing unparalleled depth and dedication to every client interaction.
              Licensed in 1977 after graduating from South Texas College of Law, he began his career with a clear sense of purpose:
              to advocate for individuals and families facing complex legal issues with clarity, empathy, and skill.
            </p>
            <p>
              His experience spans a wide range of legal areas, but his core focus has long been in foreclosure defense, probate, and
              real estate law. Whether representing homeowners fighting to keep their properties or families navigating sensitive estate
              matters, James is known for being both strategic and compassionate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to entering the legal profession, James served his country in the Vietnam War, an experience that sharpened his
              discipline and resilience. He later worked in the political sector, where he learned how to navigate systems, advocate
              persuasively, and communicate effectively under pressure. These qualities continue to define his legal practice today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout his career, James has maintained a hands-on, client-first approach. He is deeply committed to building relationships
              based on trust and ensuring that every legal document, filing, and negotiation is handled with precision and care. Clients
              appreciate his ability to translate legal language into plain terms and his unwavering commitment to protecting their interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              James's reputation is a reflection of the lasting impact he has had on those he serves. He believes in doing the hard work behind
              the scenes so that his clients can focus on what matters most: finding clarity, resolution, and peace of mind.
